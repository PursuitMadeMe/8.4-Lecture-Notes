 Guiding Questions

- What is a higher order function?
  // A function that accepts or returns another function - will pass calbacks to all higher order array methods

- What is a native array method?
// a built in method that can be used.  This comes out of the box in JS and allows us to do powerful things to our arrays. 

- What does it mean for a function to produce side effects?
// A function that modifies something outside its paramters - for example

- What does it mean for a function to return a value?
// allows us to save the value 

- Is it possible for functions that return values to also produce side effects?
// yes but it should be avooided

- The `.forEach()` method expects at least one argument. What data type is this argument?
// A callback function.  This function tells forEach what to do for each item in the array

- What is a callback function?  
//  A function that is passed as a parameter.  One way to think of a callback is 
// a set of instructions that we want our native array methods to execute

- The `.forEach()` method's callback function has up to three parameters. What are these parameters?
  The element (from the original array) that we want to execute the callback on
  The index current index of the array 
  The array on which forEach() was called

  const comics = [
    { title: "Calvin & Hobbes", author: "Bill Watterson", kind: "print" },
    { title: "Zen Pencils", author: "Gavin Aung Than", kind: "web" },
    { title: "Nancy", author: "Olivia James", kind: "print" },
    { title: "False Knees", author: "Joshua Barkman", kind: "web" },
  ];

  //  Update the code below so that it uses `.forEach()` instead of a `for` loop. Inside of `printAllComics()` you will have to write another, anonymous function.
 
// MAP stands for Make Array Plz 
  const printAllComics = (comics) => {
    // Write your code here.
    // we can also destructure comic in our callback to shorten this
    let result = comics.forEach(( comic, index, originalArray) => {
      console.log(`(${index + 1} out of ${originalArray.length}) ${comic.title} by  ${comic.author}`);
    })
    return result

   }
let allComics = printAllComics(comics);

// console.log(allComics)
allComics = null;
// console.log(comics)
  /* - How can you update your `.forEach()` code so that it prints out the following?

  1. "Calvin & Hobbes" by Bill Watterson
  2. "Zen Pencils" by Gavin Aung Than
  3. "Nancy" by Olivia James
  4. "False Knees" by Joshua Barkman

    How about this??

  (1 out of 4) "Calvin & Hobbes" by Bill Watterson
  (2 out of 4) "Zen Pencils" by Gavin Aung Than
  (3 out of 4) "Nancy" by Olivia James
  (4 out of 4) "False Knees" by Joshua Barkman
  

- Replace the `.forEach()` in your code with `.map()`. Does the code still run?
   // the code runs but map needs to be returned!  
   // additionally we need to return each item in our callback to populate the array that .map() returns
- What are some of the differences between `.forEach()` and `.map()`?
   map returns a new array - forEach returns undefined and is primarly for side effects

- Instead of logging, `return` inside of your callback function. How can you access the result of your `.map()` function call?
we can save this return value - a new array - in a variablwe

- Write a new function called `getAuthors()`. The function should take in an array of comics (like above) and return an array of just the authors' names.

 

*/

function getAuthors(comics) {
  return comics.map((comic) => {
    return comic.title
  })
 // Write your code here!
}
const result = getAuthors(comics);


  //> [ "Bill Watterson", "Gavin Aung Than", "Olivia James", "Joshua Barkman"]
 
/*
- Now, update your `getAuthors()` function to make use of the `.map()` method. The function should produce the same result.

  Compare what you had written with what you have now. What is a benefit of using the `.map()` method?

- Mentally evaluate the code below before running it. What do you think will be logged out? Why?
*/

  function getTitle(comic) {
   return comic.title.toUpperCase(); // <---- we can add any JS operation here we like!
  }

  const result2 = comics.map((comic) => getTitle(comic));// < ----- notice here we can pass our already declared getTitle() to our callback in .map()

// ****** GROUP ACTIVITY! 20 minute challenge! *******

// Comic sales are down!  
// It's up to us to autmoate some reviews and map them to a new array we can use.

let reviews = [
  "Was amazing", 
  "Is the best thing EVER", 
  "Is such a good comic!", 
  " - GET THIS COMIC!", 
  " I. CAN'T. EVEN.", 
  "is truly a masterpice of the genre"
];
// using .map() return a new array of strings such that 
// the titles of each comic are concatenated with a random string from the review array.

const makeFakeReviews = (comics, reviews) => {
  return comics.map( (comic) => {
    // This function returns a new string of a comic and a random review from the outer scope of makeFakeReviews
     return `${comic.title} ${reviews[Math.floor(Math.random() * reviews.length)]}`;
    });
};
let fakes = makeFakeReviews(comics, reviews);



// How does the `.filter()` method differ from `.map()`? From `.forEach()`?
// returns a new array like map BUT only elements that pass the provided function is as truthy;

// Mentally evaluate the code below before running it. What do you think will be logged out? Why?

function isPrintComic(comic) {
  return comic.kind === "print" ;
}
// notice here we have => function and no {} on one line.  Thus, we need no return statement
const filtered = comics.filter(comic => isPrintComic(comic));

console.log(filtered);
  
 

// What would happen if the callback function had the code below instead? Why?

 
  // function isPrintComic(comic) {
  //   return comic.kind;
  // }
 // Since every `comic` has a `kind` this would simply return a TRUTHY value to filter - thus every item would be passed into the array to be returned from filter()

 //`type` _is not_ a key on each comic object. Keeping that in mind, would happen if the callback function had the code below instead? Why?

  // function isPrintComic(comic) {
  //   return comic.type;
  // }


// Every invocation of comic.type would return `undefined` - which evaluates to falsy according to the rules of .filter().  Thuse NOTHING would be passed to the return array.  We would retrn AN EMPTY ARRAY

 
 


 // ****** GROUP ACTIVITY! *******

 // The following function represents a roll of a six sided die;
 let rollDie = () => {
   return Math.floor(Math.random()*6+1)
  }
  // rolls represents an array of numbers rolled
  let rolls = [];
 // As a group - write a function rolls 500 dice and records the results in rolls;
 const roll500 = () => {
  let i = 0;
  while (i < 500) {
    rolls.push(rollDie());
    i++;
  }
 }

 roll500();
 let wins = rolls.filter(roll => roll  > 4);
 let noWins = rolls.map((roll) => {
    return roll < 4 ? roll : 4 
 })


 




 // A five or a six is considered a winning roll
 // using .filter() how can we determine how many winning rolls there are?

 // using a .map() how can we return an array that has NO winning rolls?


// How does the `.find()` method differ from `.filter()`? From `.map()` or `.forEach()`?

//What will be the difference between `filterResult` and `findResult` after the code is run below?
() => {
  console.log(hello)
}
 
  function getJoshuaBarkmanComic(comic) {
    return comic.author === "Joshua Barkman"
  }

  const filterResult = comics.filter(comic => getJoshuaBarkmanComic(comic));
  const findResult = comics.find(comic => getJoshuaBarkmanComic(comic));
 // Will Calvin & Hobbes or Nancy be returned by the following code? Why?

 
  function isWebComic(hotdog) {
    return hotdog.kind === "web"
  }

const result3 = comics.find((comic) => isWebComic(comic));
const result4 = comics.find(isWebComic);

console.log(result3)
console.log(result4)

 

/* Take a look at the table below. What does each column mean?

  | Method       | Callback expected return value | Method return value | Destructive? |
  | ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ |
  | `.forEach()` | Nothing.                       | Nothing.            | No.          |
  | `.map()`     | Anything.                      | An array.           | No.          |
  | `.filter()`  | Boolean.                       | An array.           | No.          |
  | `.find()`    | Boolean.                       | Anything.           | No.          |

- Although none of the methods above are _inherently_ destructive methods, is it possible to cause mutations with those methods? Should you?
