/* Higher Order Native Array Methods
These lesson notes cover `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.find()`.
 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson you should be able to:
- Describe the input and return values of `.forEach()`.
- Use `.forEach()` to solve code problems.
- Describe the input and return values of `.map()`.
- Use `.map()` to solve code problems.
- Describe the input and return values of `.filter()`.
- Use `.filter()` to solve code problems.
- Describe the input and return values of `.find()`.
- Use `.find()` to solve code problems.
---
 Guiding Questions
- What is a higher order function?
  // A function that accepts or returns another function
- What is a native array method?
// a built in method that can be used 
- What does it mean for a function to produce side effects?
// A function that modifies something outside its paramters
- What does it mean for a function to return a value?
// allows us to save the value 
- Is it possible for functions that return values to also produce side effects?
// yes but it should be avooided
- The `.forEach()` method expects at least one argument. What data type is this argument?
// A callback - this i
- What is a callback function?
- The `.forEach()` method's callback function has up to three parameters. What are these parameters?

  //  Update the code below so that it uses `.forEach()` instead of a `for` loop. Inside of `printAllComics()` you will have to write another, anonymous function.

  /* - How can you update your `.forEach()` code so that it prints out the following?
  1. "Calvin & Hobbes" by Bill Watterson
  2. "Zen Pencils" by Gavin Aung Than
  3. "Nancy" by Olivia James
  4. "False Knees" by Joshua Barkman
    How about this??

  (2 out of 4) "Zen Pencils" by Gavin Aung Than
  (3 out of 4) "Nancy" by Olivia James
  (4 out of 4) "False Knees" by Joshua Barkman
  
- Replace the `.forEach()` in your code with `.map()`. Does the code still run?
- What are some of the differences between `.forEach()` and `.map()`?
- Instead of logging, `return` inside of your callback function. How can you access the result of your `.map()` function call?
- Write a new function called `getAuthors()`. The function should take in an array of comics (like above) and return an array of just the authors' names.

/*
- Now, update your `getAuthors()` function to make use of the `.map()` method. The function should produce the same result.
  Compare what you had written with what you have now. What is a benefit of using the `.map()` method?

  let rolls = [];
 // As a group - write a function rolls 500 dice and records the results in rolls;
 // using .filter() how can we determine how many  5's and 6's were rolled?


// How does the `.find()` method differ from `.filter()`? From `.map()` or `.forEach()`?

//What will be the difference between `filterResult` and `findResult` after the code is run below?

// Is it possible to modify the `getJoshuaBarkmanComic()` function so that it could instead find any author? If so, how so? If not, why not?

// Will Calvin & Hobbes or Nancy be returned by the following code? Why?

/* Take a look at the table below. What does each column mean?
  | Method       | Callback expected return value | Method return value | Destructive? |
  | ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ |
  | `.forEach()` | Nothing.                       | Nothing.            | No.          |
  | `.map()`     | Anything.                      | An array.           | No.          |
  | `.filter()`  | Boolean.                       | An array.           | No.          |
  | `.find()`    | Boolean.                       | Anything.           | No.          |
- Although none of the methods above are _inherently_ destructive methods, is it possible to cause mutations with those methods? Should you?
